Base prompt (used for each part, swapping in the appropriate spec and function name):

---
You are helping me complete a CSC 372 verification assignment. I will give you a C function stub that already contains an ACSL contract. Please fill in ONLY the function body so that the implementation is straightforward C code adhering to standard Frama-C/WP practices. 

Requirements:
1. Do not remove or edit the ACSL comment block.
2. Keep the implementation iterative (no recursion) and use simple loops/conditionals as needed.
3. Add loop invariants/variants if the verification tool would reasonably require them.
4. Do not introduce extra helper functions or headers; stay within the stub provided.
5. Follow the intent of the spec precisely; no undefined behavior.

Return ONLY the completed function definition. Assume `#include <stddef.h>` is already present.

For "falsifying" versions we reuse the same prompt but allow a higher temperature (0.6) so the LLM might produce a subtly incorrect implementation. We then keep the first incorrect output that Frama-C does not validate.
