Prompt:
You are helping me complete a CSC 372 verification assignment. I will give you a C function stub that already contains an ACSL contract. Please fill in ONLY the function body so that the implementation is straightforward C code adhering to standard Frama-C/WP practices.

Requirements:
1. Do not remove or edit the ACSL comment block.
2. Keep the implementation iterative (no recursion) and use simple loops/conditionals as needed.
3. Add loop invariants/variants if the verification tool would reasonably require them.
4. Do not introduce extra helper functions or headers; stay within the stub provided.
5. Follow the intent of the spec precisely; no undefined behavior.

Return ONLY the completed function definition. Assume #include <stddef.h> is already present.

```
#include <stddef.h>

/*@
  requires n > 1;
  requires 0 <= k < n;
  requires 0 <= j < n;
  requires k != j;
  requires \valid(a + (0 .. n-1));
  assigns a[k], a[j];
  ensures a[k] == \old(a[j]);
  ensures a[j] == \old(a[k]);
  ensures \forall integer i; 0 <= i < n && i != k && i != j ==> a[i] == \old(a[i]);
*/
void p1_swap(int *a, int n, int k, int j) {
  // TODO
}
```

Response:
```
void p1_swap(int *a, int n, int k, int j) {
  int tmp = a[k];
  a[k] = a[j];
  a[k] = tmp;
}
```
